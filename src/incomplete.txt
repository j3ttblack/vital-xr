What still needs to be done:
    - CustomerAdmin - delete org 
    - CustomerAdmin - update org
    - CustomerAdmin - view all users in orgs
    - Possibly VxrAdmin - update orgs
    - All user-level stuff (update, delete, view their data)

    - Possibly add styling to the org page that lets them see their organization and user level
Plus testing and documentation
